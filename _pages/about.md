## 🎓 Academic Journey
- **Ph.D. student**, Biostatistics and Data Science, UT Health Science Center at Houston  
- **M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics**, University of Melbourne

I am currently a Research Assistant (RA) at UTHealth, focusing on tobacco control research. My academic journey includes ongoing Ph.D. studies in Biostatistics and Data Science at the UT Health Science Center at Houston.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research interests span a wide range of areas in biostatistics and data science, particularly applied to public health and tobacco control:

- Analysis of data from wearable devices
- Speech emotion recognition for medical applications
- Longitudinal & EMA (Ecological Momentary Assessment) data analysis
- Multivariate and time series analysis
- Machine learning in health research
- E-cigarette and tobacco use behaviors
